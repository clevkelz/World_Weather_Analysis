# World Weather Analysis
## This analysis built a way for clients to find hotels based on a cities within a preferred temperature range.  Random latitude and longtiude coordinates were generated for 1,500 locations.  This information was fed through the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain the current weather data for at least 500 unique cities around the world, including the maximum temperature, the humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.  After initial testing, the analysis was expanded to capture data from another 2,000 random locations to add the current weather description to the data already collected.  This part of testing also added the ability to pick four locations from the list of cities generated from the second set of random locations.  A map with driving directions to these four locations was obtained through the Google Maps Directions API.
